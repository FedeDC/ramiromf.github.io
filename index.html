<p>Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I am Ramiro Marco Figuera, a planetary scientist from Sant Feliu de Llobregat, a town near Barcelona. I lived and worked in Spain, Hungary, Germany, The Netherlands, UK and now I am based in Bremen, Germany.</p>

<p>I did my undergraduate in Geomatics at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and worked at the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia as a trainee. Later I moved to Berlin were I studied a MSc in Geodesy and Geoinformation Sciences. While studying and working at the Technical University of Berlin I started getting interested in planetary science and I decided to go deeper. I did and internship at the European Space Agency (ESTEC) working with the Lunar Lander team doing some illumination studies at the Lunar south pole. After a few months I went back to Berlin to finish my master thesis. I did it about new computational techniques using graphic cards to actually calculate the illumination, and it was a success! I managed to reduce a 24 hours process to just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>After a few months in Sheffield and Manchester, I got a PhD position at Jacobs University Bremen. My PhD topic is "Resource evaluation on the Moon and Mars: volatiles on the surface and upper crust". I also work in the <a href="http://earthserver.eu">EarthServer project</a> as lead developer of <a href="http://planetserver.eu">PlanetServer-2</a>, an online tool to visualize an analyze planetary science data. </p>
