I lived and worked in Spain, Hungary, Germany, The Netherlands, UK and now I am based in Bremen, Germany.\r\n\r\nI did my undergraduate in Surveying Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and worked at the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia as a trainee. Later I moved to Berlin were I studied an MSc in Geodesy and Geoinformation Sciences. While studying and working at the Technical University of Berlin I started getting interested in planetary science and I decided to go deeper. I did and internship at the European Space Agency (ESTEC) working with the Lunar Lander team doing some illumination studies at the Lunar south pole. After a few months I went back to Berlin to finish my master thesis. I did it about new computational techniques using graphic cards to actually calculate the illumination, and it was a success! I managed to reduce a 24 hours process to just 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter a few months in Sheffield and Manchester, I got a PhD position at Jacobs University Bremen. My PhD topic is \"Resource evaluation on the Moon and Mars: volatiles on the surface and upper crust\". I also work in the [EarthServer project] (http://earthserver.eu) as lead developer of [PlanetServer-2](http://planetserver.eu), an online tool to visualize an analyze planetary science data. \r\n\r\n## CV\r\n### Education\r\nCurrently - PhD in Planetary Science, Jacobs University Bremen, Germany.\r\n2014 MSc.
