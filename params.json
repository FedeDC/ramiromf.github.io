  "body": "### About me\r\nHi! Welcome to my personal website. I am Ramiro Marco Figuera, a planetary scientist from Sant Feliu de Llobregat, a town near Barcelona. I lived and worked in Spain, Hungary, Germany, The Netherlands, UK and now I am based in Bremen, Germany.\r\n\r\nI did my undergraduate in Geomatics at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and worked at the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia as a trainee. Later I moved to Berlin were I studied an MSc in Geodesy and Geoinformation Sciences. While studying and working at the Technical University of Berlin I started getting interested in planetary science and I decided to go deeper. I did and internship at the European Space Agency (ESTEC) working with the Lunar Lander team doing some illumination studies at the Lunar south pole. After a few months I went back to Berlin to finish my master thesis. I did it about new computational techniques using graphic cards to actually calculate the illumination, and it was a success! I managed to reduce a 24 hours process to just 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter a few months in Sheffield and Manchester, I got a PhD position at Jacobs University Bremen. My PhD topic is \"Resource evaluation on the Moon and Mars: volatiles on the surface and upper crust\". I also work in the [EarthServer project] (http://earthserver.eu) as lead developer of [PlanetServer-2](http://planetserver.eu), an online tool to visualize an analyze planetary science data. \r\n\r\n### CV\r\n### Publications\r\n### Contact\r\nRamiro Marco Figuera\r\nDepartment of Physics and Earth Sciences\r\nJacobs University Bremen\r\nCampus Ring 1, 28759 Bremen, Germany\r\nOffice: Research III, Room 99b\r\nEmail: r.marcofiguera@jacobs-university.de\r\nTel: +49 (0)421 200 3226\r\n\r\n",
